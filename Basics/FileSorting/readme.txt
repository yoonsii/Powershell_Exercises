You have a directory containing a mix of different types of files (e.g., .txt, .docx, .xlsx, .pdf) and you need to organize them into separate subdirectories based on their file types. Write a PowerShell script that will scan the files in the directory and move each file into a subdirectory corresponding to its file type. For example, all .txt files should be moved to a "TextFiles" subdirectory, all .docx files to a "WordFiles" subdirectory, and so on. If a subdirectory doesn't exist for a particular file type, create it. Additionally, log the names of the files moved and the destination subdirectories to a text file named "file_mover_log.txt" in the same directory as the script.
